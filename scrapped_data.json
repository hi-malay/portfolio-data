From June 2022 to April 2023, I witnessed Malay's exceptional growth and contributions to the Plivo team.\nMalay is a technically proficient engineer with a deep understanding of modern web technologies. He played a critical role in transforming our Contacto product from an Electron.js desktop application to a highly responsive web app. This initiative improved real-time communication through websockets and BroadcastListeners and significantly enhanced our customer work speed by eliminating the need for platform switching.\nIn addition, his efforts to optimize our development process by transitioning from Create React App to Vite resulted in a 2x faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a 4x improvement in build times. Malay's leadership skills were instrumental in developing key features such as email and WhatsApp channels and implementing Agent Monitoring and Barging features that attracted four new customers. This clearly demonstrated his ability to drive impactful changes.\nFurthermore, Malay's commitment to quality is evident in his development of a UI component library and the integration of a logging mechanism using LogRocket.\nMalay is an excellent communicator and a great team player. He is proactive in problem-solving and always eager to share knowledge and collaborate with his peers. His contributions have propelled our product development forward and fostered a collaborative and innovative team environment.\nI am confident that Malay will continue to bring his unique talents, dedication, and innovative mindset to any future role he undertakes. He would be a valuable asset to any team.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information."
